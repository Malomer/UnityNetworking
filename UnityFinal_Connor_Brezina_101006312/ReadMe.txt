Things sorta don't spawn together
red box makes the flag respawn(harmful to flag holder)(also an extra way for the flag holder to lose his flag)
green box speeds up player(useful for both)
plays particles when not picked up
both powerups dont last forever
scoring sorta works...
once time is up it shows the winner they won and loser they lost
